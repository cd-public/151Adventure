# File: AdvRoom.py

"""
This module is the starter file for the AdvRoom class, which represents
a single room in the game and is analogous to the TMQuestion class in
the teaching machine.  The starter file contains the header lines for
the methods you need for Milestone #1.  As you move on to later
milestones, you will need to add a few more methods as described in
the project handout.
